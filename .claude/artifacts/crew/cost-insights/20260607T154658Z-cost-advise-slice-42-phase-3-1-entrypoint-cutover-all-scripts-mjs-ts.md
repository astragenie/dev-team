- median cache hit: 98.7%
- median Opus share: 0.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 82.7% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [HIGH] file-rereads
- 39 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [MEDIUM] subagent-overuse
- 5 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 16.6:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [MEDIUM] non-repo-dominant
- Only 14.5% of spend ($8.67 of $59.94) came from the repo-derived session. Bookkeeping is misaligned with where work actually happened.
- **Suggested action:** Either work directly inside the repo's own Claude session, or move the work to its real home. Cross-repo work hides accountability and inflates the next session's context.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 3 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] subagent-creep
- Subagent dispatch count has grown across the last 3 slices: 3 → 4 → 5. Each cold-start re-derives session context.
- **Suggested action:** Bundle review + validation into a single subagent when scope is small. Reserve parallel dispatches for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $59.9446 is 595% above the last-3 median of $8.6284.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.
