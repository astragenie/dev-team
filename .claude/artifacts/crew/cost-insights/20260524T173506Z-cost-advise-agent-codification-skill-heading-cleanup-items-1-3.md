# Cost Advisor

Target slice: **Agent codification + skill heading cleanup (items 1-3)**
Cost: $223.5260 · duration 87.9 min · cache hit 98.6% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $57.76
- p75 $: $123.24
- median cache hit: 99.2%
- median Opus share: 97.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 83.8% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [HIGH] file-rereads
- 16 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [HIGH] subagent-overuse
- 12 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] compaction
- 11 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [LOW] tool-failure-rate
- 6.3% tool failure rate (42/665).
- **Suggested action:** Tool failures are pure waste. Plan the call shape (paths, flags, JSON schemas) before invoking; check pwd / file existence first.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 5.4:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [MEDIUM] non-repo-dominant
- Only 20.3% of spend ($45.48 of $223.53) came from the repo-derived session. Bookkeeping is misaligned with where work actually happened.
- **Suggested action:** Either work directly inside the repo's own Claude session, or move the work to its real home. Cross-repo work hides accountability and inflates the next session's context.

### [HIGH] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 6 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 97.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
