# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: C

Target slice: **qa-expert test-quality lens (flaky / anti-pattern / mutation advisory)**
Cost: $112.8325 · duration 23.9 min · cache hit 99.6% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $38.62
- p75 $: $58.23
- median cache hit: 99.2%
- median Opus share: 100.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 96.0% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [MEDIUM] file-rereads
- 10 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [MEDIUM] subagent-overuse
- 6 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [MEDIUM] compaction
- 1 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 4.3:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 4 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] subagent-creep
- Subagent dispatch count has grown across the last 3 slices: 4 → 5 → 6. Each cold-start re-derives session context.
- **Suggested action:** Bundle review + validation into a single subagent when scope is small. Reserve parallel dispatches for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $112.8325 is 94% above the last-3 median of $58.2307.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.

### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 100.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
