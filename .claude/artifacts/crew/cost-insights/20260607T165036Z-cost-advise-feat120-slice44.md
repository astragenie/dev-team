# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: F

Target slice: **FEAT120 SLICE44**
Cost: $13.9636 · duration 31.0 min · cache hit 97.9% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $8.65
- p75 $: $59.94
- median cache hit: 98.7%
- median Opus share: 0.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] file-rereads
- 43 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [MEDIUM] subagent-overuse
- 5 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] compaction
- 3 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [LOW] tool-failure-rate
- 5.9% tool failure rate (8/135).
- **Suggested action:** Tool failures are pure waste. Plan the call shape (paths, flags, JSON schemas) before invoking; check pwd / file existence first.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 6.0:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

## Cross-slice trends
### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $13.9636 is 61% above the last-3 median of $8.6700.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.
