## Per-slice findings
### [LOW] file-rereads
- 3 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [MEDIUM] compaction
- 1 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [LOW] tool-failure-rate
- 9.7% tool failure rate (3/31).
- **Suggested action:** Tool failures are pure waste. Plan the call shape (paths, flags, JSON schemas) before invoking; check pwd / file existence first.

### [HIGH] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 14.0:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.
