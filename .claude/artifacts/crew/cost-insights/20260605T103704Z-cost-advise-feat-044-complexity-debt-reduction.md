- median cache hit: 98.8%
- median Opus share: 74.5%

## Per-slice findings
### [MEDIUM] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 77.1% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [HIGH] file-rereads
- 37 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [HIGH] subagent-overuse
- 13 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] compaction
- 103 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [HIGH] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 8.4:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [HIGH] compaction-cascade
- 103 compactions + 13 subagent dispatches — context overflow driven by excessive dispatching.
- **Suggested action:** Each subagent cold-starts the cache; the lead's context grows with each handoff read. Target ≤3 dispatches per slice. Bundle review + validation when scope is small. Write checkpoint handoffs at ≥3 compactions instead of dispatching more agents.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 3 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] compaction-drift
- Compaction count has increased across the last 3 slices: 0 → 101 → 103. Context window pressure is growing.
- **Suggested action:** Split work into smaller slices and write checkpoint handoffs earlier. If compaction hit once, treat it as a budget warning and wrap up that slice.

### [MEDIUM] subagent-creep
- Subagent dispatch count has grown across the last 3 slices: 4 → 6 → 13. Each cold-start re-derives session context.
- **Suggested action:** Bundle review + validation into a single subagent when scope is small. Reserve parallel dispatches for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 74.5% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
