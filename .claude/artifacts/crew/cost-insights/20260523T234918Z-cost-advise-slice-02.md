Cost: $51.7296 · duration 9.7 min · cache hit 98.8% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 4 slices)

- p75 $: $102.23
- median cache hit: 99.9%
- median Opus share: 100.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 89.7% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [LOW] large-tool-output
- 90th-percentile tool result is 5,011 bytes.
- **Suggested action:** Prefer Grep with head_limit, Bash | head -N, or narrower file Read offsets over broad output. Big tool results inflate cache_create.

### [LOW] subagent-overuse
- 3 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] compaction
- 3 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [HIGH] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 18.0:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 3 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 100.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
