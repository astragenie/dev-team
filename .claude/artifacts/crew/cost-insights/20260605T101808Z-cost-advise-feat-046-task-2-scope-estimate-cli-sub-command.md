# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: B

Target slice: **FEAT-046 Task 2 scope-estimate CLI sub-command**
Cost: $18.1793 · duration 5.4 min · cache hit 99% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $12.22
- p75 $: $14.87
- median cache hit: 98.4%
- median Opus share: 0.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 82.6% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [MEDIUM] subagent-overuse
- 4 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 4.4:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [MEDIUM] non-repo-dominant
- Only 0.0% of spend ($0.00 of $18.18) came from the repo-derived session. Bookkeeping is misaligned with where work actually happened.
- **Suggested action:** Either work directly inside the repo's own Claude session, or move the work to its real home. Cross-repo work hides accountability and inflates the next session's context.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 3 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $18.1793 is 24% above the last-3 median of $14.6932.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.
