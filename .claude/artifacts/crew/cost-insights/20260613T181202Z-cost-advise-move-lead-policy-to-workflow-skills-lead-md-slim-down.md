# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: D

Target slice: **Move lead policy to workflow skills (lead.md slim-down)**
Cost: $186.2709 · duration 28.2 min · cache hit 99.7% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $18.12
- p75 $: $38.62
- median cache hit: 99.0%
- median Opus share: 100.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 98.7% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [MEDIUM] file-rereads
- 5 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [HIGH] subagent-overuse
- 8 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [LOW] preamble
- 5 assistant turns before the first tool call.
- **Suggested action:** Long narration before action wastes output tokens. Skip narration on routine slices; act first, summarise after.

### [LOW] tool-failure-rate
- 6.3% tool failure rate (9/144).
- **Suggested action:** Tool failures are pure waste. Plan the call shape (paths, flags, JSON schemas) before invoking; check pwd / file existence first.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 5.5:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [MEDIUM] non-repo-dominant
- Only 8.0% of spend ($14.96 of $186.27) came from the repo-derived session. Bookkeeping is misaligned with where work actually happened.
- **Suggested action:** Either work directly inside the repo's own Claude session, or move the work to its real home. Cross-repo work hides accountability and inflates the next session's context.

### [HIGH] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 5 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $186.2709 is 928% above the last-3 median of $18.1231.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.

### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 100.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
