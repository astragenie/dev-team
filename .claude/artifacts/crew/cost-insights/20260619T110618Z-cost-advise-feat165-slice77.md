# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: C

Target slice: **FEAT165 SLICE77**
Cost: $76.1837 · duration 26.0 min · cache hit 99.6% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $58.23
- p75 $: $76.18
- median cache hit: 99.5%
- median Opus share: 100.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 100.0% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [MEDIUM] file-rereads
- 7 redundant Read calls of files already loaded this session.
- **Suggested action:** Trust prior Read results unless the file was edited. Each redundant Read injects fresh tool output that busts the cache.

### [MEDIUM] subagent-overuse
- 5 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 100.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
