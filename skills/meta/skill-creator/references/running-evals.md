# Running and Evaluating Test Cases

This is one continuous sequence — do NOT stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.

Put results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.

## Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn

For each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.

**With-skill run:**

```
Execute this task:
- Skill path: <path-to-skill>
- Task: <eval prompt>
- Input files: <eval files if any, or "none">
- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/
- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about>
```

**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):
- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.
- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.

Write an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case:

```json
{
  "eval_id": 0,
  "eval_name": "descriptive-name-here",
  "prompt": "The user's task prompt",
  "assertions": []
}
```

## Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions

Don't just wait — draft quantitative assertions and explain them to the user. Good assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively.

Update `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with assertions once drafted.

## Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data

When each subagent task completes, save timing data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:

```json
{
  "total_tokens": 84852,
  "duration_ms": 23332,
  "total_duration_seconds": 23.3
}
```

This is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere.

## Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer

Once all runs are done:

1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json`. Use fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details`).

2. **Aggregate into benchmark:**
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>
   ```
   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md`. Put each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.

3. **Do an analyst pass** — read `agents/analyzer.md` for what patterns to look for: non-discriminating assertions, high-variance evals, time/token tradeoffs.

4. **Launch the viewer:**
   ```bash
   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \
     <workspace>/iteration-N \
     --skill-name "my-skill" \
     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   VIEWER_PID=$!
   ```
   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.

   **Headless/Cowork:** Use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead.

5. **Tell the user:** "I've opened the results in your browser. The 'Outputs' tab lets you click through each test case and leave feedback; 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. Come back when you're done."

## Step 5: Read the feedback

When the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:

```json
{
  "reviews": [
    {"run_id": "eval-0-with_skill", "feedback": "the chart is missing axis labels", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"run_id": "eval-1-with_skill", "feedback": "", "timestamp": "..."}
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}
```

Empty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus improvements on cases with specific complaints.

Kill the viewer server when done:

```bash
kill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null
```
